is the Cloud? What are the different types of Cloud?","text":"<ul> <li> <p>What is the Cloud exactly?</p> <ul> <li>The Cloud (Computing) is a way of providing access to computer resources, characterized by its self-service availability, elasticity, openness, mutualisation and pay-per-use<ul> <li>Self-service and on-demand resources of storage capacity and computing power, according to the customer's needs. This contrasts with so-called \"traditional\" computing where any need to change an application requires manual operations and therefore time.In the Cloud, the need, automatically detected by the application or at the customer's request, is taken into account and satisfied immediately.</li> <li>Openness : Cloud services are accessible through a network, using standardized techniques, whether from a computer, a amartphone or a tablet</li> <li>Mutualization : The Cloud mutualizes its IT resources (servers, CPU, RAM, storage, network) to serve its customers, to whom the ordered resources are allocated according to automatic processes. Mutualization improves scalability and elasticity; it facilitates the automatic adaptation of resources to variations in demand</li> <li>Pay-per-use: The quantity of services consumed in the Cloud is measured for purposes of control, adaptation of technical means and billing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>With the Cloud, we should talk about \"XAAS\". What's XAAS?</p> <ul> <li>The acronym XaaS refers to Everything-as-a-Service. This term refers to the different models of Cloud computing \"as a service\"</li> <li>Indeed with the Cloud, we no longer speak of infrastructure components but of services, which explains the syntax of the terms (aaS). XaaS services are organised into 3 categories<ul> <li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) : Provides CPU, storage, RAM, Network</li> <li>PaaS (Platform as a Service) : Provides ready-to-use middlewares (database, web server,etc.)</li> <li>SaaS (Software as a Service) : Provides ready-to-use softwares (CRM, expense claim management, online office automation tools such as Office 365, payroll management, etc.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>We talk about \"Infrastructure as a Service\" is the case where:<ul> <li>The client manages the middlewares and softwares (executables, settings, databases)</li> <li>The Cloud provider manages server hardware, virtualization layers, storage, networks</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is a model where the customer has, on a paying subscription basis, an IT infrastructure (servers, storage, backup, network) that is physically located at the Cloud provider</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>XaaS service in detail</p> <ul> <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)<ul> <li>It's the lowest level of service. It consist of providing access to a virtualized computer park. Virtual machines on which the customer can install an operating system and applications. The service is similar to traditional data center hosting services, and the trend is towards highest level services (PaaS or IaaS) that are more abstract in terms of technical details</li> </ul> </li> <li>Platform as a Service<ul> <li>In this type of service, the operating system and infrastructure tools are the responsibility of the Cloud provider. The customer has direct access to specialized services (web front-ends, middlewares, databases, etc.) that can be customized: the customer chooses, in a Marketplace, the design of the technical solution to be deployed.
