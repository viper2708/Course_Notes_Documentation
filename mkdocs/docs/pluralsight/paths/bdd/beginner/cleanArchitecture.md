##  Introduction
### Overview
* Purpose
    * Philosophy of architectural essentialism
    * Set of patterns, practices, and principles
    * Alternative to traditional architecture

* Focus
    * Enterprise applications
    * Agile architecture

* Audience
    * Developers
    * Architects

* Prerequisites
    * Basic programming experience
    * Basic architecture experience

### What is Clean Code?
* What is Software Architecture?
    * High-level
    * Structure
    * Layers
    * Components
    * Relationships

* Levels of Architectural Abstraction
    * System
    * Sub-systems
    * Layers
    * Components
    * Classes
    * Data and Methods

* What is Bad Architecture?
    * Complex
    * Incoherent
    * Rigid
    * Brittle
    * Untestable
    * Unmaintainable

* What is Good Architecture?
    * Simple
    * Understandable
    * Flexible
    * Emergent
    * Testable
    * Maintainable

* What is Clean Architecture?
    * Architecture that is desgined for the inhabitants of the architecture... not for the architect... or the machine.

### Why invest in Clean Code?
* Why invest in Clean Architecture?
    * Cost/Benefit
    * Minimize cost
    * Maximize value
    * Maximize ROI

* Why Clean architecture?
    * Focus on the essential
    * Build only what is necessary
    * Optimize for maintainability

* What do architects do?
    * Context is king
    * All decisions are a tradeoff
    * Align with business goals
    * Use the best judgement

##  Domain Centric Architecture
### Introduction
* Database-centric architecture
    * UI
    * Business Logic
    * Data Access
    * Database

* Domain-centric architecture
    * Presentation + Persistence + Infrastructure
    * Application
    * Domain
    * Database

* Essential vs. Detail in Domain Centric Architecture
    * Domain is essential
    * Use cases are essential
    * Presentation is a detail
    * Persistence is a detail

* Examples of such architecture
    * Hexagonal architecture
    * Onion architecture
    * Clean architecture

* Why use Domain-centric architecture?
    * Pros
        * Focus on domain
        * Less coupling
        * Allows for DDD
    * Cons
        * Change is difficult
        * Requires more thought
        * Initial higher cost
